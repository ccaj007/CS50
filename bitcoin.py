"""
Bitcoin is a form of digitial currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

    Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, 

, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:

import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...

Outputs the current cost of
Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import requests
import json
import sys
import ast

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.exit('Missing command-line argument')

try:
    qty = ast.literal_eval(sys.argv[1])
except Exception as err:
    sys.exit('Command-line argument is not a number')


print(qty * 100)

response = request.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json")
o = response.json()
print(o)



#
#o = response.json()
#for result in o["results"]:
#    print(result["trackName"])
